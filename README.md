# recipe-rating
This is a project for DSC80 at UCSD

## Introduction
This project is about the recipes with ratings from the website food.com. The questions for this project is: What is the relationship between calories and average rating of recipes. There are 234429 rows in the dataset and the relevant columns to my questions are colories, average_rating_per_recipe and the description of these two columns are:

colories: colories of the recipes(#).

average_rating_per_recipes: the mean rating of the recipes.

## Cleaning and EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)

### Data Cleaning
1. Left merging two dataframe raw_recipes and raw_interactions.
2. Filling np.nan to replace data that should be missing.
3. Adding new columns: average_rating_per_recipe
4. Extracting nutrition columns to the following new columns: calories, total fat, sugar, sodium, protein, saturated fat, carbohydrates.
5. Dropping unnecessary columns: nutrition, contributor_id

### Univariate Analysis

<iframe src="./fig/rating_distribution.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

There are more recipes that are higher ratings.

<iframe src="./fig/calories_distribution.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

There are more recipes that are lower calories.


### Bivariate Analysis

<iframe src="./fig/scatter_rating_calories.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

The relationship between calories and rating is weak.

### Interesting Aggregates

|   rating |   calories |
|---------:|-----------:|
|        1 |    486.595 |
|        2 |    446.598 |
|        3 |    425.791 |
|        4 |    405.047 |
|        5 |    415.213 |

recipes with lower rating tend to have higher calories

## Assessment of Missingness

### NMAR Analysis
the rating columns in my dataset is NMAR because the recipe contributor may not want
rate the ratings of the recipes.

### Missingness Dependency

<iframe src="./fig/dist_abs_diff_calories_means.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

the simulated data a different from the observed data. we reject the null hypothesis that
the distribution of calories when rating is missing is the same as the distribution of calories when rating is not missing. Hence, we conclude that the missingness in the rating
column is dependent on gender.

## Hypothesis Testing

null hypothesis: recipes with rating 5 has the same distribution of calories as recipes with
                 rating 1
                 
alternative hypothesis: recipes with rating 5 does not have the same average calories as
                        recipes with rating 1

significane level: 5%

<iframe src="./fig/permutation_fig.html" width=800 height=600 frameBorder=0></iframe>

p value = 0.0

we reject the null hypothesis that recipes with rating 5 has the same distribution of calories as recipes with rating 1
